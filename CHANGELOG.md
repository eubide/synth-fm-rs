All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-12-09

### Major: Lock-Free Architecture Refactoring

Complete refactoring from `Arc<Mutex<>>` to a fully lock-free architecture for zero-contention audio processing.

#### New Files
- **`command_queue.rs`**: SPSC ringbuffer for GUI/MIDI -> Audio commands
- **`state_snapshot.rs`**: Triple buffer for Audio -> GUI state snapshots

#### Architecture Changes
- **SynthEngine**: Runs exclusively on audio thread, owns all synthesis state
- **SynthController**: Interface for GUI/MIDI threads, sends commands via ringbuffer
- **StateSnapshot**: Read-only view of synth state for GUI display
- **TripleBuffer**: Atomic swap with CAS for lock-free state updates

#### GUI Improvements
- All controls now read from snapshots (never block audio)
- All changes sent via SynthCommand enum through ringbuffer
- Effects panel fully refactored to lock-free (Chorus, Delay, Reverb)
- New snapshot structs: `ChorusSnapshot`, `DelaySnapshot`, `ReverbSnapshot`, `OperatorSnapshot`

#### Performance
- Zero mutex contention in audio callback
- Command latency < 10ms (processed at buffer start)
- Snapshot updates every 1024 samples (~23ms at 44.1kHz)

#### Code Quality
- Zero warnings (`cargo check` and `cargo clippy`)
- 10 unit tests passing (concurrent stress tests included)
- Removed all `#[allow(dead_code)]` from active effect commands

### Added: MIDI Program Change Support

- **MIDI Program Change (0xC0)**: Select presets via MIDI program change messages
  - Handler in `midi_handler.rs` for 0xC0 status byte
  - `LoadPreset(index)` command in command queue
  - `SynthEngine::load_preset()` applies preset to all voices
  - `SynthController::load_preset()` convenience method
  - Presets stored in SynthEngine for audio-thread access

### Fixed: Portamento Curve

- **Authentic Portamento Range**: Adjusted from 0.8s max to 2.5s max
  - Old formula: `0.003 + (time/99)^1.8 * 0.8` (3ms to 800ms)
  - New formula: `0.005 + (time/99)^2.0 * 2.5` (5ms to 2.5s)
  - More authentic DX7-style glide behavior for slow, expressive portamento

### Verified Working (removed from Known Issues)

- **Operator Feedback**: Confirmed working correctly
  - GUI sends `OperatorParam::Feedback` to all 16 voices via command queue
  - `operator.rs` applies feedback as `last_output * feedback * PI / 7.0`
- **Cross-operator Feedback**: Verified per DX7 spec
  - Algorithms correctly use `ops[n].get_feedback_output()` for feedback routing
